DESCRIPTION 
       The satops tool makes extensive use of the Red Hat Network Satellite (RHN Satellite) XML/RPC API to provide automated tasks.
       Those tasks help manipulating RHN Satellite content, mainly Standard Operating Environment (SOE) data.
       The primary goal of the tool is to offer and Primary/Secondary architecture to complement the RHN Satellite product.
       This allow to have multiples RHN Satellites in sync. For instance a production and DR in active/active mode.

       A provide a configuration file for satOps options:
       To specify objects to operate, by default all objects are deactivated
       Use 'show config' command to generate example

       The available commands are:
              destroy
                  Delete all objects on target RHN Satellite
    
              export
                  Export RHN Satellite objects to files (ascci or binary formats) into <path> directory

              extras
                  Remove objects on target RHN Satellite not present in source RHN Satellite
          
              import
                  Import RHN Satellite object from files (ascii or binary) located into <path> directory
  
              run
                  Execute Ruby 'plug-in' file 

              sync
                 Synchronise objects from source RHN Satellite to target RHN Satellite
                 Equivalent of export/import but in one go

              show

       Notes
            The Source RHN Satellite is never modified 

            The Target RHN Satellite is most likely to be modified

       Operations are executed on object groups only if present (or uncommented) in configuration file 


       Export/Import 
            The directory to export data to or from must exist

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Activate debug output
 
       -h, --help
              This help

       -l, --log
              Append logs to file. By default logs go to Standard Output

       -t, --tls
              Activate Secure (HTTPS) sessions

       -w, --warnings
              Activate Ruby Verbose 

       Import/Export command
          ascii | bin
          - ASCII: YAML
          - Bin: Marshalling

SHOW_OPTION
  sat | config

SATELLITES
  -s SAT-FILE, --satconfig=SAT-FILE

   SAT-FILE
     YAML formated file providing Satellite details:
     Use 'show sat' command to generate template
      
CONFIG
  -c CONFIG-FILE, --config=CONFIG-FILE

   CONFIG-FILE
     YAML formated file providing configuration options:
     Use 'show config' command to generate template

The above commands can be applied on RHN Satellite objects such as:
  Activation keys
  Software Channels
  Configuration channels
  Kickstarts
  Kickstart File preservations
  Kickstart Keys
  Kickstart Snippets
  Systems
  System custom information
  System groups and Users

The config' file determines which objects to run or not.

The SatOps interfaces with up to two RHN Satellite servers, a Source and a Target:
  A Source Satellite is used to read data from and therefore is NEVER modified.
  A Target Satellite is the destination of data and therefore OFTEN modified.
Some commands only require one Satellite server to be provided.
For instance "export" command only need a Source while "import" or "destroy" commands require a Target only.

EXAMPLES
       # Generate config options example:
       ./satops.rb show config

       # Run synchronisation operation with logs to standard output
       ./satops.rb -s satellites -c config sync

       # Run ASCII export  operation with logs to file
       ./satops.rb -s satellites -c config -l export.log export ascii /tmp/satops-export/

       # Run binary import operation with logs to file
       ./satops.rb -s satellites -c config -l import.log import bin /tmp/satops-export/

       # Destroy operation with logs to standard output
       ./satops.rb -s satellites -c config destroy

       # Run extra operation 
       ./satops.rb -s satellites -c config extras
